 == Default Configuration

  Default values for the properties are stored in My Documents \ MB \ 20xx-x64 \ config
  Name of a configuration file is < PC Name >.PostProcessing.txt

  == Post Processing Data

  Data User Model is located in Assets / Templates / Shading Elements

Data supportes drag'n'drop operations:
 * if you drag camera / light / null, they will connected into Data Camera / Lens Flare Light / DOF Focus Object
 * if you drag one data into another, the values from on data will be copied into another one

 * if Camera is assigned, then post processing effect become a local, just for a specified camera

 * Post procesing effect applies only on user camera and skip any system camera and Perspective as well

 * Better to not combine Camera Effects (Antialiasing, Depth Of Field) with post processing effects
For Antialiasing better to use render option. BUT the option conflicts with Reflection shader, so will not see reflections!

  == Effects

  = Common Notes

   DOF and SSAO and any other effect which is using depth buffer could be sensible to camera near/far planes
GLSL Shader stores value in single float, so please take care about too big values for the far plane

  = DOF
  
   In DOF Effect you can manually specify a focal distance.
   If Null is assigned in the Focus Object Property, Focal distance will be computed automatically

   When Use Camera DOF Properties is on, then Focal Distance and Focal Range will be taken from Camera Real-Time effects

   To increase a quality of DOF, try to insrease values for Samples and Rings

   = Lens Flare

   PosX and PosY are percent of screen size (widht and height)
